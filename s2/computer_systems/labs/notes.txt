- - - - - MEMORY - - - - -
ROM (Read Only Memory) - All reading at full speed - contents built in time of manufacture
POM (Programmable ROM) - Programmed by a once only irreversable operation
ERPOM (Erasable PROM) - Can be removed from the computer and erased and programmed (slowly) by using special aparatus
EEPROM (Electrically EPROM) - Can be erased and reprogrammed byte to byte but writing is slower than reading
	- commonly used in flash drives
	
- - - - - STACKS - - - - -
- simple and efficient storage/recalling of data
- reduces need for storing memory addresses
- can only access data at the top of the stack
- hardware stacks use dedicated shift registers

- - - - - ARCHATECTURE - - - - -
	Von Neumann
- most common CPU archatecture
- control bits and data bits share common memory space / hardware
- allows processes to be interrupted (and stored as data) while higher priority tasks are executed, and then restored and resumed
- requires use of stack, but stacks can be implemented in software as well as hardware
	
	Harvard
- used in microcontrollers and other devices where there is little memory and speed is most important
- control bits and data bits are kept seperate
- generally runs faster and generally more secure
- more expensive and less versatile than Von Neumann
- data bus and control buses can be different widths, types
- reasonably immune to buffer overflow attacks
	
	Modified Harvard
- Von Neumann with seperate instructions and data caches in the CPU
- has speed advantage of Harvard but flexibility of Von Neumann
- used in ARM and most intel CPUs
- supports stacks and interrupts

LDRB R1, [R0+#1] - value held in R1 is stored in the word address r0+#1
Machine Code - ready to execute binary code generated by the program compilation process
Parity Bit - takes sum of all bits and appends it to be even to not cause error (sum = 5, parity = 1, sum = 4, parity = 0)
