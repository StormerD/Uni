Hello, my name is Dylan Rodwell, my student ID is 105341089. I have tasked with creating a simple shape drawing program using c# and the splashkitSDK. I am doing option 2 of the final project. Over the weeks I have added various features which I will demonstrate today.

The features of my program I will go over include:
- drawing a shape to the window,
- changing the type of shape drawn,
- changing the colour of the background,
- selecting shapes,
- deleting the most recently drawn shape,
- deleting selected shapes,
- changing the colour of all shapes,
- drawing my name in shapes,
- drawing random shapes,
- changing the size of all shapes,
- and saving the current canvas to a file and loading it.

To go over the basics of the program, you draw shapes with the LMB. The shapes available are a rectangle, circle and line, selected with R, C and K respectively, and if you press L it prints 9 parallel lines.

Each shape has its own class that inherits from a parent "Shape" class. Each shape object knows it's (x, y) position, if it is selected and it's colour, and each individual type of shape knows things specific to them.

Rectangles know their width and height, circles know their radius, and lines know their length.

Each shape can draw itself, draw it's outline, check if a point is in the shape, save the shape to the save file, and load data from the save file.

Every shape drawn on the screen is added to a list on a "Drawing" class that keeps track of the canvas and all the shapes on it. The drawing object knows every shape on the canvas, the background colour, and a streamreader and streamwriter for saving and loading. Drawing objects can draw every shape at once, select a shape on the mouse position, add and remove shapes from the shape list, and save and load the current canvas. 

To go over the basics of the program, 
- shapes
- shape types

Now lets talk about the program and it's features.
- selecting different shapes.
- adding, selecting and removing shapes.
- background.
- colour all.
- draw name.
- draw random shapes.
- scale shapes.
- saving and loading.
