### Hometown:

I come from the town of Mornington located in the Mornington Peninsula, south of melbourne. Throughout my life, I have lived in Mornington since the age of 7 years. Although i have also lived in Queensland for a brief period and Sydney from when I was 3 - 7 years old. Mornington offers close public parks and gathering spots, shopping centers that are not too far away, and our established 'Mornington Main Street', well known for our collection of restaurants next to the beach and nice shopping outlets.
