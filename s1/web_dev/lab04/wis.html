            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>Sending and
                receiving text messages has become part of our daily activities. Can you imagine yourselves without a
                mobile
                phone for a day? Would you leave home without it? And would you be wondering how those mobile
                applications
                are written, were you can send a text message to a specified number, and you get the necessary
                information
                needed in a form of a reply, or simply registering your name for a contest?
            </p>

            <p>This article discusses the
                things you need to know in order to program your own wireless information service. In validating the
                concept, a sample program was created using Sun Microsystems's Java[tm] 2 Standard Edition (J2SE[tm])
                and
                Java Communication API. The application developed had been tested on a PC equipped with an infrared
                dongle
                that connects to an infrared enabled phone, in this case a Nokia 8310. The application is divided into
                two
                parts, the messaging library and the information service application.

            <h2>Understanding the SMS Message</h2>

            <p>Before developing the application, let us take a look at how a message is handled by the mobile phone. A
                Short
                Messaging Service or SMS text can be up to 160 characters long. Each character of the message is
                represented
                using 7 bits instead of 8. 8-bit messages with a maximum of 140 characters are usually not viewable as
                text
                messages. This is normally used for ringtones and images. Unicode (UCS2) text messages, which are used
                for
                Asian languages, are 16-bit messages. This type of messages has a maximum length of 70 characters.
                Blinking
                SMS is also represented as a 16-bit message otherwise known as Flash SMS.

    <aside>Upon completion of the SMS system library, various database inquiry systems can be developed. This can be
        a dictionary, boroscope, or registration system. The possibilties are endless.
