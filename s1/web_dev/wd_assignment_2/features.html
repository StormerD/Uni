            <h2>Homepage</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In all my pages I have incorporated a navigation bar in the header that can be used to navigate to
                    every other page. This nav bar also highlights the background of the current page you are on in the
                    nav bar.</li>
                <li>
                    My homepage also features a css animation to make the text over my image slide across the screen to
                    it's intended position. For this image and text combination I took information from my favorite
                    local ice cream shop and adapted that style into my page. This can be found <a href="index.html">here</a>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Register Page</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>My registration form has inline error messages appearing at the heading of where the issue is so it
                    is easy for users to tell where their submission is invalid. This can be found
                    <a href="register.html">here</a>.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <article id="art3">
            <h2>Order Page</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>My order page has inline error messages like the registration page to help the user identify issues.
                    This can be found <a href="order.html">here</a>.</li>
                <li>My form has two sets of radio buttons that when the required option is selected, will display
                    additional form data that the user will need to fill out. This is done by hiding the elements using
                    JS when the page is loaded then displaying and hiding them when required. This can be found <a
                        href="order.html">here</a>.</li>
                <li>My form also has a checkbox to make the shipping address the same as the billing address to decrease
                    the effort required to fill out my form and increase user's experience. This checkbox has validation
                    to make sure the inputs of the billing address and post code are not empty before copying the values
                    to the delivery address and post code. When this checkbox is ticked it also updates the delivery
                    address and post code field live by running the function every time an input is entered into the
                    fields. This can be found <a href="order.html">here</a>.</li>
                <li>I have also used animations for my ice-cream images to grab the attention of my user and make my
                    page feel more developed and professional. The animation is different durations on each image and I
                    had to calculate percentages to make sure each image is traveling across the screen for the same
                    specific time (1.275s). I just liked the way this time looked and wanted to make it consistent with
                    each other image. This can be found <a href="order.html">here</a>.</li>
